The Programming Language Amber 
==============================

Amber is an open source scripting language, which is being developed for easy
realization of **High-Level Programming with Self-Extension**.  The term
"self-extension" means a way to extend languages' syntaxes or semantics using
capabilities of themselves, and it includes following techniques:

* Macros
* Domain Specific Languages (DSLs)
* Extensible Syntax
* Symbolic-Programming and Eval
* Dynamic and Static Reflection

Writing programs with high-level abstraction is very important in terms of
productivity, portability and performance. Since the optimal programming
language is different according to programming targets in general, capabilities
of self-extension are also important.  Amber has been designed and developed
placing the highest priority to self-extension from the start, so
self-extension of Amber is easy and has high-degree of freedom.
